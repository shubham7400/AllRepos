# Ldentist
The app in question is designed to help users get a diagnosis report for their teeth disease. The process involves taking images of the problematic teeth and posting them on the app. A doctor then examines the images and writes a diagnosis report based on the information they can gather from the images. The app is meant to provide a convenient and accessible way for users to get medical advice about their dental health without having to visit a dental clinic in person.

# Usage
To use the app and get a diagnosis report for your teeth disease, follow these steps:

Download and install the app on your mobile device.

Open the app and create an account if you haven't already.

Take clear images of your teeth, making sure to capture the area where you have a problem. You can use the app's built-in camera feature or upload images from your device's camera roll.

Post the images on the app and provide any additional information about your symptoms or concerns.

Wait for a doctor to review your images and provide a diagnosis report. This usually takes a few hours to a day, depending on the app's response time.

Once you receive the diagnosis report, read it carefully and follow any recommendations or treatment options provided by the doctor.
